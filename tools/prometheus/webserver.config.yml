    # honor_labels controls how Prometheus handles conflicts between labels that are
    # already present in scraped data and labels that Prometheus would attach
    # server-side ("job" and "instance" labels, manually configured target
    # labels, and labels generated by service discovery implementations).
    #
    # If honor_labels is set to "true", label conflicts are resolved by keeping label
    # values from the scraped data and ignoring the conflicting server-side labels.
    #
    # If honor_labels is set to "false", label conflicts are resolved by renaming
    # conflicting labels in the scraped data to "exported_<original-label>" (for
    # example "exported_instance", "exported_job") and then attaching server-side
    # labels.
    #
    # Setting honor_labels to "true" is useful for use cases such as federation and
    # scraping the Pushgateway, where all labels specified in the target should be
    # preserved.
    #
    # Note that any globally configured "external_labels" are unaffected by this
    # setting. In communication with external systems, they are always applied only
    # when a time series does not have a given label yet and are ignored otherwise.

    # in scraped data.
    #

    # by the target will be ignored.

    # track_timestamps_staleness controls whether Prometheus tracks staleness of
    # the metrics that have an explicit timestamps present in scraped data.
    #
    # If track_timestamps_staleness is set to "true", a staleness marker will be
    # inserted in the TSDB when a metric is no longer present or the target
